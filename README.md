# Basic Online Calculator
___________________________
## A standard calculator that is used predominately online, a simple to use tool for solving a multitude of mathematical equations.

## Instructions and User Features

By using a mouse select or ‘click’ the numbers on the calculator face, this can be in any sequence of your choosing.  Once you have selected the desired first set of integers, choose your operator; depending on the outcome required you can select from **‘x’** for multiplication, **‘÷’** for division, **‘-’** to subtract and of course **‘+’** for addition.
Once you have selected your operator, enter the second set of  integers and ‘click’ on the **‘=’** sign to return your result which will be displayed on the calculator screen (display).

## Inspiration
-  My project is based off a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw) tutorial by a web developer called [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified).  This method was a fantastic learning experience as I was able to really put the core concepts into practise.

-  Andrey Los's [SandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/rwmo3ow4mm) was pivitol in practising the concepts of JavaScript in a contolled enviroment.

-  For CSS styling I drew inspiration from [gambhirsharma](https://codepen.io/gambhirsharma/pen/ExwBKop).

## Colorway
-  With the help from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) and thier free color wheel I chose the following, that was set using a linear gradient style rule in CSS.

## A Brief History on the Calculator

The first true calculator was invented by French inventor and mathmatician Blasie Pascal in 1642. The calculation were prefoemned through a clockwork-type
mechanism.  This proved to be a difficult product to reproduce and so very few were ever made.

Thoms de Colar took his turn at inventing a calculator that was eaier to produce however, were sizable and comprehensive.

We then skip to 1945 with the first handheld device invennted by Curt Herstark.  SHaped like a portly pepper grinder, the 'Curta' calculators took off and produced in large quantities up until 1970.

Japan became the front runner by inventing the first digital pocket calculator we all know and love and thus the 'Curta' calculator demand faded. 

We owe these inventors a bif deal of gratitude as calculators have enhanced the ability to understand mathematics on a much larger sacle.

To the following indivuduals and organisations I would like to attribute for my sucsessful deploment of Project 2.
- My project was based on a calculator tutorial by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified).
This walkthrough method has made a huge contribution to my understanding of the core concepts, as my extensive 'comments' and 'Docstrings' can attribute throughout the project.
- [Andrey Los](https://codesandbox.io/s/rwmo3ow4mm) from [Code Sand Box ](https://codesandbox.io/s/rwmo3ow4mm?file=/index.js) for a simple 'playground' to try out concepts in a controlled enviroment.
- [gambhirsharma](https://codepen.io/gambhirsharma/pen/ExwBKop) from [CodePen](https://codepen.io/trending) for inspiration to use the 'box-shadow' css with calculator buttons.
