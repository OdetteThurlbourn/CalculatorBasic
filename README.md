## A Brief History on the Calculator
_____________________________________


The first true calculator was invented by French inventor and mathematician Blasie Pascal in 1642. The calculation was preformed through a clockwork-type 

mechanism.  This proved to be a difficult product to reproduce and so very few were ever made. 

  

Thoms de Colar took his turn at inventing a calculator that was easier to produce however, were sizable and comprehensive. 

  

We then skip to 1945 with the first handheld device invented by Curt Herstark.  Shaped like a portly pepper grinder, the 'Curta' calculators took off and produced in large quantities up until 1970. 

  

Japan became the front runner by inventing the first digital pocket calculator we all know and love and thus the 'Curta' calculator demand faded.  

  

We owe these inventors a big deal of gratitude as calculators have enhanced the ability to understand mathematics on a much larger scale.  

## Instructions and User Features

By using a mouse select or ‘click’ the numbers on the calculator face, this can be in any sequence of your choosing.  Once you have selected the desired first set of integers, choose your operator; depending on the outcome required you can select from **‘x’** for multiplication, **‘÷’** for division, **‘-’** to subtract and of course **‘+’** for addition.
Once you have selected your operator, enter the second set of  integers and ‘click’ on the **‘=’** sign to return your result which will be displayed on the calculator screen (display).

## Inspiration
-  My project is based off a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw) tutorial by a web developer called [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified).  This method was a fantastic learning experience as I was able to really put the core concepts into practise.

-  Andrey Los's [SandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/rwmo3ow4mm) was pivitol in practising the concepts of JavaScript in a contolled enviroment.

-  For CSS styling I drew inspiration from [gambhirsharma](https://codepen.io/gambhirsharma/pen/ExwBKop). What most excited me was the 'shadow' effect you can see on the buttons of the calculator.

## Colorway
-  With the help from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) and thier free color wheel I chose the following, that was set using a linear gradient style rule in CSS.

## Font

- I styled the heading of the webpage with the use of a Google font namly, 'Nunito'.
