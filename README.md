To the following indivuduals and organisations I would like to attribute for my sucsessful deploment of Project 2.
- My project was based on a calculator tutorial by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified).
This walkthrough method has made a huge contribution to my understanding of the core concepts, as my extensive 'comments' and 'Docstrings' can attribute throughout the project.
- [Andrey Los](https://codesandbox.io/s/rwmo3ow4mm) from [Code Sand Box ](https://codesandbox.io/s/rwmo3ow4mm?file=/index.js) for a simple 'playground' to try out concepts in a controlled enviroment.
- [gambhirsharma](https://codepen.io/gambhirsharma/pen/ExwBKop) from [CodePen](https://codepen.io/trending) for inspiration to use the 'box-shadow' css with calculator buttons.
